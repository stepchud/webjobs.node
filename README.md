# webjobs.node
A small node site

This site allows the user to request web URLs in a browser form and see the results of their requests. Updates appear
automatically (no refresh needed) as long as the browser websocket is connected. The results can be viewed on a details page.

This is a sample work project for a job application. I solved the problem using a combination of technologies:
* Node.js express server
* Websockets for two-way browser <-> server communication
* Redis Pub/Sub for event queue
* Redis database for data storage
* Promise-based architecture built on Bluebird

## Data Model
__Job__ represents the user's request and stores the URL, status, and result. Errors are also stored in the result.
__Queue__ manages jobs and creates workers to work them.
__Worker__ performs the request and saves the result.

## Installation
Assuming you have node/npm installed, simply clone this repository. To start the server:

    npm install
    npm start

## Configuration
Default webserver port is 8000, websocket is 8111. You can change these by setting PORT and WS_PORT environment variables, respectively.
When changing WS_PORT, it is necessary to also update the bundled react script with browserify. For example, if you want to run on 8123 and 8124, you would run:

    browserify -t [envify --WS_PORT 8124] -t [babelify] app/app.js -o app/public/bundle.js
    PORT=8123 WS_PORT=8124 npm start
